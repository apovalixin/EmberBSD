# Raspberry Pi 5 (C1)

[Board catalog](README.md) · [Build instructions](../../README.ember.md#building)

The capability table preserves earlier published hardware results. The
headless-base update below records a separate physical run.
Board revision: C1 in the earlier support record.

AArch64 VM do not validate this board's camera, audio or GPU/NPU paths.

## Evidence

### Headless base update, 2026-10-07

The lab Pi 5 reported DMI product `Raspberry Pi 5 Model B`, version
`D04170`, four Cortex-A76 cores and 8 GiB RAM. The update used microSD,
UEFI/ACPI and the root-partition ELF `/netbsd`. The DMI value alone does
not establish a silicon revision. Existing UEFI firmware was preserved;
its SHA256 is recorded below, but its exact source revision was not
re-established during this update.

Native GCC 12.5 built `EMBER64 #0`, four required modules and a reduced
base from `0108f0692febed373069b5b14bb5912015b2fd88`. The
[headless update procedure](../boot/aarch64-base-update.md) retains the
C/C++ runtime and installs no desktop, camera stack or OpenCV. Existing
applications and developer tools were preserved, not removed by this
in-place update. A general installation image was not produced.

The first reboot at 12:47:28 UTC ran the new kernel with its matching
`if_cemac_acpi`, `bcm2712btcom`, `rp1wmcodec` and `rpi5button` modules.
Wi-Fi, DHCP, SSH and existing startup services returned at this stage.
All 16 memfd cases passed; the previous kernel failed the two partial-page
cases with the same test executable. All three FP-state modes passed.
The previous kernel also passed those FP modes on this CPU.

The complete candidate libc passed a bounded smoke check, 850 CAS checks,
two binary128 matrix/mode cases and 27 existing libc/pthread cases.
The binary128 trap case skipped because hardware IOE was not writable.
These checks selected and verified the candidate DSO explicitly; they
were performed before system-wide installation.

The reduced base passed strict release file-list checks and a chroot
shell/loader/OpenSSL/SSH check. Installation completed at 13:53:14 UTC.
Seven core files, including libc, init, the loader and sshd, matched their
accepted build outputs. Local configuration hashes were unchanged and
`sshd -t` passed. Required radio firmware was restored from the verified
pre-update copy. `postinstall` updated MAKEDEV and mtree; its obsolete
warning for the required `bcm43xx` firmware directory was not applied.

The final reboot started at 13:54:00 UTC. The old Wi-Fi address did not
respond afterwards or after a power cycle. The operator subsequently
reported finding the board over Ethernet and handed further work to
another developer. That report is not a recorded post-reboot SSH or libc
test. Wi-Fi recovery, installed-library acceptance after boot and sustained
operation remain unverified. Camera, OpenCV, audio playback and graphics
were outside this update's acceptance scope.

### Earlier support matrix

Results were migrated from the [published support matrix](https://github.com/apovalixin/EmberBSD/blob/fe2727f6ef675868eba642efa73c5a0e33f92191/README.md#supported-boards)
and [hardware notes](https://github.com/apovalixin/EmberBSD/blob/fe2727f6ef675868eba642efa73c5a0e33f92191/README.ember.md#hardware-support-and-validation)
on 2026-10-07. These sources do not supply a complete per-check receipt
with tested OS/firmware revisions and dates. The source commit identifies
the documentation snapshot, not the kernel used in every original test.
Future validation should use the [evidence format](adding-a-board.md#record-the-result).
