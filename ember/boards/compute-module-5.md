# Compute Module 5 (D0)

[Board catalog](README.md) · [Build instructions](../../README.ember.md#building)

The 2026-10-08 hardware check used Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 Rev 1.0,
BCM2712 D0, 4 GiB RAM and nominal 64 GB eMMC on Waveshare CM5-NANO-B.
The carrier PCB revision and exact four-wire fan model were not established.

Long-run stability has not been established. Application results from an
AArch64 VM do not validate this board's camera, audio or GPU/NPU paths.

## Hardware check 2026-10-08

The tested kernel is `EMBER64 #10`, built with GCC 16.2.0 for
`aarch64--netbsd` from commit
[`df809fb0d3843130dd1b0f08fb8610bb54261581`](https://github.com/oxtech-ember/EmberBSD/commit/df809fb0d3843130dd1b0f08fb8610bb54261581).
Cross-builds ran on macOS; execution and acceptance ran on the physical CM5.
The source check compared 35,620 kernel/common/build/client files against that
commit with no mismatches. The subsequent client guard change
[`5f8ab2a5`](https://github.com/oxtech-ember/EmberBSD/commit/5f8ab2a5)
produced a byte-identical wpa_supplicant binary and also cross-built hostapd.
Later changes merged into main are not automatically covered by this receipt.

The four board modules were built with the matching source and kernel
configuration. Only the Ethernet module was loaded for this acceptance;
installing the other modules is not evidence for their peripherals.
The existing UEFI was retained, not rebuilt from current main. Its exact source
revision is unknown. The `RPI_EFI.fd` snapshot after the final reboot at
13:20 UTC had SHA256 `d94ce975090358c38938e9c16037d2eecc5fffc29828029ff2d6460a189ed883`;
its whole-file hash changes across boots, so this is a snapshot identifier,
not a reproducible firmware build identity.

The radio was CYW43455, firmware 7.45.265 (FWID 01-b677b91b), on a 5 GHz
channel-52 access point offering WPA2/WPA3. An SAE-only client profile required
PMF. Firmware capability reporting was checked independently from connection
success. See [configuration, implementation and checks](../boot/bwfm-sae.md).

- 106 parser/security-boundary assertions passed on the host with ASan/UBSan
  and natively on CM5; 13 live ioctl checks passed on CM5.
- SAE group 19/H2E completed with CCMP/BIP. After traffic-key installation,
  the firmware reported `wsec=0x604`, `wpa_auth=0x40000`, `mfp=2`.
- An 8 MiB file was uploaded and downloaded with the peer route forced through
  bwfm0; byte comparison and SHA256 matched. This was repeated on final #10.
- Three disconnect/reconnect cycles completed in approximately 14 seconds
  each, with zero firmware control timeouts after command serialization.
- An incorrect password failed SAE authentication (status 15) during a
  35-second observation. It never connected or fell back to WPA2.
- The separate WPA2-PSK profile connected with CCMP and firmware `mfp=0`.
  Restoring the SAE profile re-established required PMF.
- After restoring the permanent profiles and rebooting, SAE/PMF and both
  network access paths returned automatically. Installed hashes were checked.

These are functional checks, not a throughput comparison, deauthentication
attack test, long soak or validation of another board/access point.
During an earlier test that administratively lowered cemac0, the board restarted
unexpectedly. No crash dump established the cause. Normal gigabit traffic is
verified; repeated Ethernet down/up and its interaction with Wi-Fi are not.

## Cooling

The carrier's [official schematic](https://files.waveshare.com/wiki/CM5-NANO-B/CM5-NANO-B-Sch.pdf)
shows switched 5 V power, PWM and tachometer on its four-pin fan connector.
The installed fan's exact model is unknown. The operator observed repeated
stops at low and 175/255 PWM, and continuous rotation at maximum 250/255.
Tachometer edges in an earlier short probe did not establish steady rotation.

The [maximum-cooling policy](../boot/thermal-fan.md) uses the existing ACPI
`_AL0` devices and survives a reboot when saved in sysctl.conf. It preserves
temperature monitoring. It is an explicit operating policy for this fan;
it does not establish working automatic speed control. No UEFI update or
raw MMIO utility is required. The existing UEFI remains installed.

## Home mesh and cooling check, 2026-10-08

The physical board booted GCC 16.2.0 `EMBER64 #3`, built on macOS from
`b78f10c721f7c397ef7b67e3aa6ec8fe65210d7e`. `kern.buildinfo` reports that revision.
The kernel, four matching modules and fixed wpa_supplicant came from that
source. The client and hostapd cross-builds passed using the updated headers.
The optional button rc service is from `ad44f1803`.

| Updated artifact | SHA256 |
| --- | --- |
| `/netbsd` and `/boot/netbsd` | `7b4603f6fdcae29ba6d7819bbd84bdd5bb774107801a6b56bc48e0fbc83864e5` |
| `/boot/netbsd.img` | `1dde929bd282404a828c018409827b8a0a23f1e5b29cff5ccfd0ad5af7bcd2c6` |
| wpa_supplicant 2.11 | `fe1e7dd5dfde52dce4f587e2448ef1d70e627867fd13bc030b992105da83c0dd` |
| rpi5button.kmod | `2960fbc1b1a4d7c9330096ff4aa0b0ef4f5679fdc7cd973a4f0b44f1c3698f3f` |

The other three module hashes match the earlier receipt. Installed files
were verified after reboot; previous kernel/module sets remain available
for rollback. The existing UEFI was retained.

The CYW43455 firmware remains 7.45.265. A KeeneticOS 5.1.6 mesh advertising
WPA2/WPA3 allowed WPA2 and SAE group 19/H2E with required PMF on 5 GHz
channel 60 (80 MHz firmware chanspec `0xe23a`). Firmware reported
`wsec=0x604`, `wpa_auth=0x40000`, `mfp=2`, `roam_off=1` and `wnm=0`.
An 8 MiB upload/download passed byte comparison and SHA256 with the peer
route explicitly using bwfm0. This is a functional check, not a benchmark.
The fixed [external-SAE client](../boot/bwfm-sae.md#reconnecting-with-external-sae)
completed three reconnects to the same 5 GHz BSSID without clearing PMKSA
in 15, 14 and 14 seconds. A separate WPA2 profile connected in about
13 seconds; restoring SAE took about 13 seconds. An unpinned connection
also selected a stronger 2.4 GHz AP, so 5 GHz is available but not guaranteed
by a dual-band SSID. Autonomous firmware WNM/roaming remains disabled.

[Scan metadata](../boot/bwfm-scan.md) now preserves firmware primary channels
and exports signed RSSI as unsigned quality without wraparound. Its 166
checks and the thermal-notification contract passed on macOS and natively
in an EmberBSD AArch64 VM; six existing native kernel contracts also passed.
The board already connected on 5 GHz before the metadata fix, so this check
does not assign all previous band-selection failures to that defect.

The maximum-cooling setting loaded automatically after reboot and the
operator confirmed continuous fan rotation. On the preceding `72c00a3bbc19`
build, 19 samples over 18 minutes retained D0 with temperatures 37.5–41.3 °C.
Invalid values -1 and 2 were rejected; changing the policy to 0 and back to 1 produced D3 and D0.
Suspend/resume, sustained load and automatic intermediate speeds remain
unvalidated. 802.11r/802.11v are not added by this update.

## Earlier evidence

The original eMMC/serial/Wi-Fi results were migrated from the
[published support matrix](https://github.com/oxtech-ember/EmberBSD/blob/fe2727f6ef675868eba642efa73c5a0e33f92191/README.md#supported-boards)
and [hardware notes](https://github.com/oxtech-ember/EmberBSD/blob/fe2727f6ef675868eba642efa73c5a0e33f92191/README.ember.md#hardware-support-and-validation)
on 2026-10-07. That commit identifies a documentation snapshot, not every
historical test's kernel. Future checks should use the
[evidence format](adding-a-board.md#record-the-result).
