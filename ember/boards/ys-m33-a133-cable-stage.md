# YS-M33 composed cable write stage

[Cable installation](ys-m33-a133-cable-install.md) ·

The [composed API](../tools/a133-cable-install.rb) binds a release before unlock,
verifies unlocked recovery, installs persistent recovery protection and writes
the three guarded image ranges. An outer private journal remembers when
protection began so an interrupted run cannot accidentally re-enter unlock
after env or boot have changed. It leaves the device in protected recovery;
accepted first boot and the complete factory installer remain separate.

## Caller contract

```ruby
A133Cable.run(directory: session, manifest: manifest, adb: adb,
  serial: serial, cid: cid, original_env: original_env,
  backup: trusted_capture, mutable: trusted_mutable,
  locked_round_trip_verified: true, timeout: 600, wait_timeout: 120,
  device_root_method: 'vendor_su', recovery_root_method: 'adbd')
```

Inputs are copied before I/O. The caller must freshly verify and retain full
backup, critical copies, boot0/boot1 and quiescent mutable copies. The physical
locked Android/recovery round trip is a caller attestation, not measured by
this API. Trusted receipt fields do not authenticate an archive. The fixed
31,037,849,600-byte/17-partition YS-M33 profile is mandatory.

Verify release contents, signing, entropy and personal-data removal separately;
never clone the working reference as a fleet release. Bundle source commit,
role sizes/hashes, factory evidence, env variants and identity are pinned in
the outer context. Artifact order and filenames do not change release identity.
The image writer re-verifies the release against the pinned semantic digest
before it admits USB I/O. Changing the release or evidence refuses resume.

All calls for one tablet must use one outer directory, with no competing host
or standalone API calls. Directory exclusion is not a global device lease.
Preserve its subordinate `unlock/` and `images/` journals. Moving/removing an
active directory or replacing its lock stops later journal publication.
Inode/permission checks do not authenticate a malicious same-user owner.

## Resume behavior

The outer journal uses0700 owned directories,0600 owned regular single-link
files, descriptor-bound flock, bounded65536-byte exact checksummed state,
exclusive temporary files, fsync and atomic rename. Possible write/reboot,
verified unlock and started protection are monotonic flags. After rename,
the visible state survives subsequent directory-fsync failure reporting.
Unknown leftover temporary files are retained and never trusted.

Before the protection marker, the existing unlock journal owns resumption and
the at-most-once native reboot rule. A recorded reboot is never replayed;
operator recovery can be necessary if interruption preceded submission.
Verified unlock and hardware boot sizes are persisted before protection intent.
After that intent, every invocation skips unlock, checks selected unlocked
USB recovery/CID/GPT/hardware sizes and repeats live protection verification.
Protection requires unlocked recovery at its own repeated guards in this flow.
Exact original or exact protected full env is accepted; unknown partial env
stops without a blind repair. The env tail and retained recovery are checked.

Then the image session rechecks root → boot → resources, including previously
verified ranges. Matching bytes are not rewritten. Only a full hash mismatch
can begin one guarded rewrite in an invocation. Any persistence or transport
failure stops later stages; no automatic retry, rollback, relock or reboot.
An interrupted remote command may still complete; local cancellation does
not establish remote rollback. Resume checks actual bytes, not just receipts.

Success is `cable_write_stage_verified`, always `installation_ready=false`.
The report includes current image/protection write counts and verified roles.
Errors carry bounded symbolic reasons and redacted conservative prior-effect
hints. Invalid admission or unreadable prior state reports effects unknown.
No identifiers, private paths, credentials or binary env are printed.

## Inspection and host checks

```sh
ruby ember/tools/a133-cable-install.rb /private/tablet-session
ruby ember/tools/a133-cable-journal-test.rb
ruby ember/tools/a133-cable-install-test.rb
ruby ember/tools/a133-cable-install-cli-test.rb
ruby ember/tools/a133-install-session-regression-test.rb
ruby ember/tools/a133-recovery-protection-unlocked-test.rb
```

The CLI only inspects an existing locked journal and emits one JSON after
the lock closes. It has no initialization/write/reboot flag. Native fixtures
run actual dd against sparse files, inspect persisted intent before effects,
verify actual image bytes and preserved env/recovery/tail, and exercise resume
before/after protection publication, range drift, release mismatch and errors.
Late close and filesystem faults are injected at real I/O boundaries.

These tests do not execute vendor hooks on a physical device, prove cold
power-loss durability, verify early-boot contents after transition, accept data
preservation/full Android restore, or establish signing/first boot/fleet readiness.
No physical tablet is modified by these test commands. The historical BSP,
main reconciliation and native OS build remain separate integration gates.
