# BCM2712 first bin/render queue experiment: handoff design

Status on 2026-10-10: researched design, **not implemented or executed**.
The prerequisite [translated DMA/TFU experiment](bcm2712-v3d-dma.md) passed
once on physical CM5; this experiment is the next step of the same opt-in
path. All register, sequence and packet facts below are pinned to
Raspberry Pi Linux `43c132e8863c3bff3647033b6a7d2bf87b15501c`
(`v3d_sched.c`, `v3d_gem.c`, `v3d_regs.h`) and Mesa 26.2.4
(`src/broadcom/cle/v3d_packet.xml`, `src/gallium/drivers/v3d/v3dx_{draw,job,rcl}.c`,
`src/broadcom/common/v3d_util.c`, release SHA256
`bce5f7fbebb934373b86c999a064d52fb5065878dc57f287f95346648ec832e9`).

## Scope and prerequisites

A separate opt-in `BCM2712_V3D_QUEUE_PROBE` and proposed `EMBERV3DQUEUE`
configuration, after a completed takeover, in the same boot as the accepted
DMA experiment. The probe performs its own bounded allocations and republishes
the MMU exactly like the DMA experiment (same six rules: one segment, 4 KiB
alignment, 32-bit window, no overlap, full-value control writes, retention
after the first publishing write). No IRQ handler yet: completion is observed
by polling latched interrupt status with delivery still masked. No DRM, no
user command submission, no draws, no shaders, no GMP.

One clear-and-store job: the binner builds one empty tile list and the
render stage clears a single 64x64 tile to a deterministic color and stores
it to a raster buffer that the CPU verifies word by word.

## Submission facts (pinned)

All offsets are CORE block unless noted. Cache invalidation for ver >= 41 is
two writes; L3/L2C steps are version-gated off in the pinned source.

| Step | Register | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bin pre | `PTB_BPOS` 0x30c | 0 |
| Invalidate | `CTL_L2TCACTL` 0x30 | `L2TFLS` bit0 \| FLM_FLUSH(0) << 1 |
| Invalidate | `CTL_SLCACTL` 0x24 | 0x0f0f0f0f (0xf in TVCCS/TDCCS/UCC/ICC) |
| Bin memory | `CLE_CT0QMA` 0x170 | tile_alloc VA |
| Bin memory | `CLE_CT0QMS` 0x174 | tile_alloc size |
| Bin memory | `CLE_CT0QTS` 0x15c | ENABLE(bit1) \| tile_state VA |
| Bin submit | `CLE_CT0QBA` 0x160 | BCL VA (start) |
| Bin submit | `CLE_CT0QEA` 0x168 | BCL end — **this write starts the binner** |
| Bin done | `CTL_INT_STS` 0x50 | FLDONE bit1 latched; clear through `CTL_INT_CLR` 0x58 |
| Invalidate | same two writes | before the render submit |
| Render submit | `CLE_CT1QBA` 0x164 | RCL VA (start) |
| Render submit | `CLE_CT1QEA` 0x16c | RCL end — **this write starts the render** |
| Render done | `CTL_INT_STS` 0x50 | FRDONE bit0 |

Interrupt bits (CORE): FRDONE bit0, FLDONE bit1, OUTOMEM bit2, SPILLUSE
bit3, TRFB bit4, GMPV bit5. OUTOMEM/SPILLUSE/TRFB are failures for this
experiment, not completion. MMU faults (HUB `MMU_CTL` 0x1200 bits 27/20/12)
always win over a latched done bit. Each done wait is bounded to 500 ms;
each cache wait to 100 ms if ever polled. Statuses must latch with masks
still in force; only `INT_CLR` writes are permitted on the interrupt block.

## Memory

Seven objects, same bus_dma rules as the DMA experiment:

| Object | Size | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page table | 4 MiB | 32-bit VA subset |
| Illegal scratch | 4 KiB | MMU illegal-address target |
| tile_alloc | 12 288 B | `v3d_tile_alloc_sizes(1,1,1,0,4096)`: align(128,4096)+8192, zero draws |
| tile_state | 4 KiB | 256 B needed per tile |
| BCL | 4 KiB | the packet stream below |
| RCL | 8 KiB | packet stream plus the inline generic tile list |
| Output image | 20 KiB | 64x64 RGBA8 raster (16 KiB) plus one canary page |

PTE mapping through alias virtual addresses like the DMA experiment:
BCL/RCL read-only, tile_alloc/tile_state/output writable. tile_alloc and
tile_state legitimately change when the binner runs; the experiment must
not treat their contents as canaries. BCL/RCL/output/scratch are canaries.

## BCL packets (V3D 7.1, from v3dx_draw.c and v3dx_job.c)

Packet fields are defined in `v3d_packet.xml` with bit positions starting
after the 8-bit opcode header; encode exactly as `gen_pack_header.py` does.

1. `TILE_BINNING_MODE_CFG` (120): width-1 = 63 at [47:32], height-1 = 63 at
   [63:48], log2 tile width = 3 at [10:8], log2 tile height = 3 at [13:11],
   tile allocation initial block size 128b = 1 at [3:2], tile allocation
   (overflow) block size 128b = 1 at [5:4].
2. `FLUSH_VCD_CACHE` (19).
3. `OCCLUSION_QUERY_COUNTER` (92) with enable = false.
4. `START_TILE_BINNING` (6) — required after any prefix state.
5. `FLUSH` (4) — the epilogue; the hardware caps the bin CLs with a return.

## RCL packets (from v3dx_rcl.c)

1. `TILE_RENDERING_MODE_CFG_COMMON` (121 sub-id 0): image width 64 at
   [23:8], image height 64 at [39:24], number of render targets - 1 = 0 at
   [7:4], log2 tile width/height = 3 at [54:52]/[57:55], early-Z disable
   bit [46], depth-buffer disable bit [44].
2. `TILE_RENDERING_MODE_CFG_RENDER_TARGET_PART1` (121 sub-id 2): clear color
   low 32 bits at [63:32], internal type and clamping = RGBA8 (8) at
   [31:27], internal BPP = 32 (0) at [26:25], stride - 1 = 31 (64 texels
   32bpp is 32 units of 128 bits per two rows) at [24:18], base address 0
   at [17:7].
3. `TILE_RENDERING_MODE_CFG_ZS_CLEAR_VALUES` (121 sub-id 1).
4. `TILE_LIST_INITIAL_BLOCK_SIZE` (126): auto-chained, first block 128b —
   must match the binning config.
5. `MULTICORE_RENDERING_TILE_LIST_SET_BASE` (123): address = tile_alloc VA
   at [31:6], tile list set number 0.
6. `MULTICORE_RENDERING_SUPERTILE_CFG` (122): number of bin tile lists - 1
   = 0 at [63:61], total frame 1x1 tiles at [43:32]/[55:44], 1x1 supertiles
   at [23:16]/[31:24], supertile size in tiles - 1 = 0 at [7:0]/[15:8].
7. Initial double clear (GFXH-1742 style): `TILE_COORDINATES` (124: 0,0),
   `END_OF_LOADS` (26), `STORE_TILE_BUFFER_GENERAL` (29) with buffer = NONE,
   `CLEAR_RENDER_TARGETS` (25), `END_OF_TILE_MARKER` (27); then once more
   with a fresh `TILE_COORDINATES`; then `FLUSH_VCD_CACHE` (19).
8. Generic tile list inline in the RCL buffer:
   `TILE_COORDINATES_IMPLICIT` (125), `END_OF_LOADS`, `PRIM_LIST_FORMAT`
   (56) with a zero-data-format value, `BRANCH_TO_IMPLICIT_TILE_LIST` (21),
   `STORE_TILE_BUFFER_GENERAL` with buffer = render target 0, output image
   format rgba8 = 27, memory format Raster = 0, dither None = 0, decimate
   sample 0, height 64, raster byte stride 256 ("Height in UB or Stride"),
   address = output image VA at [95:64], `END_OF_TILE_MARKER`,
   `RETURN_FROM_SUB_LIST` (18); then `START_ADDRESS_OF_GENERIC_TILE_LIST`
   (20) covering exactly that inline range.
9. `SUPERTILE_COORDINATES` (23) with column 0, row 0.
10. `END_OF_RENDERING` (13).

## Verification

The clear color is a single deterministic word with four distinct bytes,
for example 0x305e7b4c (RGBA channels low to high, matching the rgba8
output format). Translation PASS requires: FRDONE latched with no MMU
fault and no OUTOMEM/SPILLUSE/TRFB, all 4096 output words equal to the
clear color, the output canary page untouched, BCL/RCL contents unchanged
after POSTREAD|POSTWRITE, and the scratch still zero. Partially cleared
output, wrong color order, cleared canary or a fault are distinct failures
with their own verdict strings. tile_alloc/tile_state changes are expected
evidence, not failures. After the first publishing MMU write everything
GPU-exposed is retained until reboot, on success and on every failure;
the FLDONE path must clear its status bit before the render submit so
FRDONE is unambiguous.

## Contracts and review

Same actual-source host contract family as the DMA experiment: fake
takeover window, fake bus_dma with CPU/GPU views, and a fake GPU whose
control-list executor recognizes exactly the packet stream above (byte
pattern), simulates the clear-and-store through the fake MMU and latches
FLDONE/FRDONE. Cases: every allocation/load/sync/MMIO failure, both done
timeouts, fault-before-done priority, OUTOMEM/SPILLUSE as failures,
wrong-color and partial-clear mismatches, canary writes, INT_CLR misuse,
BCL/RCL written by the GPU, retention after publication, one-shot.
Mutants: at least missing second invalidate, missing INT_CLR after FLDONE,
wrong store address/format/stride, missing START_TILE_BINNING, missing
FLUSH epilogue, release-after-publication. Independent review and a
complete clean-commit build of `EMBERV3DQUEUE` before any installation;
the ordinary CM5 recovery bundle must still verify.

## Bounds and next stages

This proves the bin and render control-list engines and the tile
clear/store datapath on one tile with no shaders. It does not prove QPU
execution, geometry, interrupts delivery, out-of-memory recovery, GMP
protection or any queueing beyond one job. The intended order after this
experiment: (B) real IRQ delivery for the same job through the ACPI
interrupt resource with INT masks owned by the probe; (C) MMU fault
recovery: a deliberately invalid PTE job that must fail cleanly and leave
the GPU usable for a following good job; (D) a DRM render interface with
GEM and a scheduler around the same submission path; (E) Mesa V3D on that
interface; (F) the accelerated desktop. Each stage stays opt-in with
contracts and review first.
