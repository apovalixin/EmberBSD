# BCM2712 V3D interrupt experiment: handoff design

Status on 2026-10-10: **implemented, contracted, reviewed by wire
evidence and physically accepted once** on the stand CM5 (see the result
below). This is stage B after the accepted [translated DMA](bcm2712-v3d-dma.md)
and [bin/render queue](bcm2712-v3d-binrender-plan.md) experiments:
real GPU interrupt delivery through ACPI instead of polled completion.

## Physical CM5 result

The `EMBERV3DIRQ` kernel from clean commit `a87680b0532` (SHA256
`23e6a952d27774cb562528ba29c576c5c55ac54c304ebac7864808a180a10daf`)
booted on the stand CM5 on 2026-10-10 and printed, after the takeover:

```text
IRQ PASS: hub TFUC and core FLDONE+FRDONE delivered as interrupts; both images verified; handlers disestablished; masks restored
```

Both GPU interrupt lines delivered their completions through
`acpi_intr_establish_irq` handlers with exactly-once ack-then-wake; the
TFU copy and the clear-and-store job both ran to verified images. Two
earlier instrumented boots produced the fixes this acceptance depends
on: handlers self-mask under a level-line storm, and the line identity
comes from wire evidence (the table above), not from the firmware
header's swapped names. The board was returned to the ordinary kernel
and rechecked. The source boot log SHA256 is
`edc13a1e216585fd17be78f94692241c8e70740ad20453b81547c7e7e738a1e3`.

## Interrupt identity (pinned)

The stand CM5 firmware declares four GPU0 interrupts in `_CRS`, all
`ResourceConsumer, Level, ActiveHigh, Exclusive` (live DSDT order, and the
firmware source `Silicon/Broadcom/Bcm27xx/Include/IndustryStandard/Bcm2712.h`
of eotics-com/edk2-platforms `c4b5d05de1f2ef633bdb4c175b5c118fcb2666ed`):

| _CRS index | GSI | Firmware header name | Meaning by wire evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 282 (0x11A) | `BCM2712_V3D_CORE_INTERRUPT` (GIC_SPI 250+32) | **HUB line** (TFU done arrived here) |
| 1 | 281 (0x119) | `BCM2712_V3D_HUB_INTERRUPT` (GIC_SPI 249+32) | **CORE line** (by elimination) |
| 2 | 133 | `BCM2712_PIXELVALVE0_INTERRUPT` | display; not ours |
| 3 | 142 | `BCM2712_PIXELVALVE1_INTERRUPT` | display; not ours |

The firmware header names are swapped relative to the silicon: on the
stand CM5 the TFU completion (a HUB-only event) latched `HUB_INT_STS`
bit 1 and stormed the line registered from _CRS index 0 (GSI 282) with
no core bits set, while GSI 281 stayed silent (first EMBERV3DIRQ boot,
post-mortem `latched hub=0x2 core=0 spurious core=8185567`). The probe
therefore registers the hub handler on index 0 and the core handler on
index 1, by evidence rather than by the header's comment.

## Register facts (pinned to raspberrypi/linux 43c132e, v3d_regs.h/v3d_irq.c)

Both blocks carry `INT_STS 0x50 / INT_SET 0x54 / INT_CLR 0x58 /
INT_MSK_STS 0x5c / INT_MSK_SET 0x60 / INT_MSK_CLR 0x64`.

- CORE bits: FRDONE bit0, FLDONE bit1, OUTOMEM bit2, SPILLUSE bit3,
  TRFB bit4, GMPV bit5 (6 on older), CSDDONE bit6 on ver 71.
- HUB bits: MMU_WRV bit5, MMU_PTI bit4, MMU_CAP bit3, MSO bit2,
  **TFUC bit1** (TFU complete), TFUF bit0; ver 71 adds GMPV in HUB.
- Handler protocol (v3d_irq.c): read INT_STS, ack the handled set through
  `INT_CLR`, return; enable is `INT_MSK_SET(~ours)` then
  `INT_MSK_CLR(ours)`; disable is `INT_MSK_SET(~0)`.
- The takeover has already masked all HUB (0x7f) and CORE (0x0fff007f)
  bits and verified the masks read back; the experiment owns unmasking
  only its handled bits and restoring the takeover masks afterwards.

## Host API (pinned to this fork)

Parse `_CRS` with `acpi_resource_parse` and take `acpi_res_irq(&res, 0)`
(core) and index 1 (hub); establish each with
`acpi_intr_establish_irq(dev, irq, IPL_VM, mpsafe=true, handler, arg,
xname)` from `sys/dev/acpi/acpi_util.c`; disestablish via the returned
cookie (`acpi_intr_disestablish`). GSI routing is already proven on this
board (sdhc at acpi0 uses irq 305/306).

## Scope and design

A separate opt-in `BCM2712_V3D_IRQ_PROBE` and proposed `EMBERV3DIRQ`
configuration, after a completed takeover, with **no** other V3D probe
enabled in the same kernel: the experiment owns the job lifecycle end to
end, because a shared polling probe would race the interrupt handler for
the same latched status bits. It reuses the two accepted job payloads
byte for byte (TFU copy and clear-and-store bin/render) but with its own
allocations and its own MMU publication, exactly as those experiments.

Flow:

1. Preconditions as before (completed takeover, MMU geometry, clean CORE
   and HUB status). Establish both handlers; no bits are unmasked yet.
2. Publish the MMU; submit the proven TFU copy. Unmask only
   `HUB_INT_TFUC` through HUB `INT_MSK_CLR`. Wait on a condition
   variable with a 500 ms timeout; the handler must observe exactly one
   TFUC, ack it through HUB `INT_CLR`, and wake the waiter. The CPU-side
   verification of the copied image still runs afterwards. Re-mask TFUC
   through `INT_MSK_SET`.
3. Submit the proven bin/render job. Unmask only `FLDONE|FRDONE` on the
   core line. The handler records each bit, acks it, and wakes the
   waiter; the experiment waits for FLDONE then FRDONE (500 ms each),
   then verifies the stored image and control-list integrity as in the
   queue experiment. Re-mask the core bits.
4. Success requires: both handlers ran at most once per job (exactly
   once in total per bit), no unexpected bits, no interrupt storm
   (spurious handler entries counted and bounded), image and canaries
   verified, no MMU fault. Everything GPU-exposed is retained until
   reboot as before; the two handlers are disestablished and both blocks
   restored to the takeover's full masks on every exit path.

Any timeout, storm, wrong line, unexpected bit or verification failure
ends the experiment with its own verdict string and remasks everything.

## Bounds

This proves interrupt delivery, handler context and wakeup for one TFU
and one bin/render completion on both GPU lines. It does not prove
shared lines, threaded/deferred processing, OOM recovery work, MMU fault
interrupt handling (bits stay masked), MSO/SPILLUSE paths, or any
sustained rate. A following stage C (MMU fault recovery) will unmask the
fault bits deliberately.

## Contracts and review

Actual-source host contract as in the previous stages, with a fake
interrupt controller: the fixture invokes the handlers on unmasked bits
at the moment the fake GPU latches them, checks ack-then-wake ordering,
exactly-once delivery, storm detection, remask-on-exit, disestablish on
every path, and the full job verification. Mutants: missing ack (storm),
missing remask, wait without timeout, unmask before establish, handler
that never wakes, ack of bits not handled, and release-after-publication.
Independent review and a clean `EMBERV3DIRQ` build before installation;
the ordinary recovery bundle must still verify.
