# A733 PCK-600 power-domain prerequisite

EmberBSD supplies a native FDT power-domain provider for Allwinner A733.
It is a prerequisite for device drivers, including GPU/NPU drivers; it does
not expose an accelerator, submit commands or claim hardware acceleration.
The owner is this OS repository. Provider attachment is verified on Zero
3W; physical accelerator-domain transitions remain unverified.

## Interface and limits

The [driver](../../sys/arch/arm/sunxi/sun60i_a733_pck600.c) attaches as
`sun60ipck` to `allwinner,sun60i-a733-pck-600`. The register range is
`0x07060000` through `0x0706afff`, with eleven 4 KiB domain windows.
Its clock is `CLK_BUS_R_PPU` (19), R-CCU register `0x1ac`, bit 0, sourced
from the high-speed oscillator. **A733 has no PPU reset.** The A523 reset
sequence must not be used on A733.

The [A733 DT](../../sys/external/gpl2/dts/dist/arch/arm64/boot/dts/allwinner/sun60i-a733.dtsi)
contains the provider, with `#power-domain-cells = <1>` and its clock.
The imported [binding IDs](../../sys/external/gpl2/dts/dist/include/dt-bindings/power/allwinner,sun60i-a733-pck-600.h)
preserve upstream numbering: NPU 4, GPU_TOP 5 and GPU_CORE 6.
The other IDs are VI 0, DE_SYS 1, VE_DEC 2, VE_ENC 3, PCIE 7, USB2 8,
VO 9 and VO1 10. This does not validate those peripherals.

Attachment enables only the provider's programming clock. It takes the
bounded GPU_TOP/GPU_CORE diagnostic below without writing domain registers.
It publishes no GPU/NPU consumer node.
A later consumer must establish its supplies, device clocks, resets,
interrupts and memory ownership in the required order before using hardware.
Shared-domain lifetime management remains the consumer's responsibility;
this FDT interface is not a runtime-PM reference-counting framework.

On a consumer request the provider:

- Validates the domain ID before accessing registers; rejects GPU_CORE off,
  following upstream's always-on restriction.
- Serializes requests and rejects existing dynamic, locked or emulated
  policy and mismatched policy/status, without writing registers.
- Leaves a domain already at the requested policy/state untouched.
- Programs the five A733 delay values only for a needed transition,
  verifies their readback, and preserves unrelated policy bits.
- Drains the policy write, checks policy and status, and waits at most
  10,000 microseconds of polling delays, in 10-microsecond steps.
- Returns `EIO` for readback or reverted-policy failure, or `ETIMEDOUT`
  when status never reaches the requested state. Further requests to that
  domain return `EIO` until reboot. Other domains remain available.

The poll budget excludes CPU scheduling and MMIO access latency. A bus
access that traps or never completes cannot be converted into a timeout
by this software loop. Readback detects ignored writes, not every bus fault.
After a failed write/transition, a rollback could race an unfinished hardware
transition. The driver therefore makes no speculative rollback writes.
Failed attachment releases its mapping and any clock reference it acquired.

The [FDT power-domain API](../../sys/dev/fdt/fdt_powerdomain.c) now accepts an
optional error-returning `pdc_set` callback. Its errors reach consumers, and
an all-domain request stops at the first error. Earlier successful domains
are not automatically rolled back. Existing `pdc_enable` callbacks retain
their previous void-callback behavior; Apple PMGR is unchanged. Truncated
DT specifiers are rejected before entering either callback.

## FDT attachment failures

The FDT bus checks power-domain errors before attaching a matched consumer.
A missing `power-domains` property retains ordinary attachment. A present
malformed property or registered provider failure prints the node name and
error, and prevents both attach and post-attach callbacks. The
node stays unattached so a later scan can retry it.

Automatic attachment uses `fdtbus_powerdomain_enable_on_attach`. An
unregistered provider retains the firmware-managed state: its DT
`#power-domain-cells` and specifier bounds are validated, then that entry
is skipped. The parser continues through other domains and never suppresses
registered callback errors, including `ENXIO`. This preserves existing
SD/eMMC attachment with the unsupported power controller described by
[RK3399's DT](../../sys/external/gpl2/dts/dist/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399.dtsi).
An invalid phandle, missing cell count or truncated entry still fails.

Explicit enable/disable APIs remain strict and return `ENXIO` for an
unregistered provider. A future A733 consumer must explicitly require its
providers before MMIO; automatic attach success is not proof of power.

Previously unmatched nodes get a fresh match search in the default pass,
so providers attached earlier in the same boot can make a driver available.
The new match must pass pre-attach before attaching. Still-unmatched nodes
keep the `not configured` diagnostic without pre-attach pinctrl or power
operations; a new match during that diagnostic cannot bypass pre-attach.
Successfully attached nodes are not powered or attached again on a retry.

This preserves pinctrl-before-power ordering for matched consumers. A
failure does not undo the selected pinctrl state or earlier successful
domains in a multi-domain request. Supply/clock sequencing and shared
resource ownership still need a separate consumer design. The later
[GPU identification binding](a733-gpu-identification.md#fdt-power-opt-in)
explicitly opts out of automatic power changes and currently observes only.

Run `sh ember/tools/fdt-power-attach-contract.sh` for the production scan,
pre/post-attach and power API regression. Use
`FDT_ATTACH_TEST_CFLAGS='-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer'`
for sanitizer checks. The contract covers quiet/default passes, absent
and malformed properties, RK3399 SD/eMMC firmware fallback, strict explicit
requests, checked and legacy callbacks, mixed domains, errors, retries,
late provider matches, unmatched diagnostics and preserved side effects.

## Read-only GPU PPU diagnostic

The provider reads GPU_TOP (5) and GPU_CORE (6) through its existing mapping,
under its existing lock. Each domain has two ordered samples of this fixed
allowlist, for 80 fault-aware 32-bit reads in total:

| Registers | Domain-relative offsets |
| --- | --- |
| PWPR, PMER, PWSR | `0x000`, `0x004`, `0x008` |
| DISR, MISR, STSR | `0x010`, `0x014`, `0x018` |
| PWCR, PTCR | `0x020`, `0x024` |
| IMR, AIMR, ISR, AISR | `0x030`, `0x034`, `0x038`, `0x03c` |
| EDTR0, EDTR1, DCDR0, DCDR1 | `0x160`, `0x164`, `0x170`, `0x174` |
| IDR0, IDR1, IIDR, AIDR | `0xfb0`, `0xfb4`, `0xfc8`, `0xfcc` |

The diagnostic publishes both domains only after every read succeeds. A
synchronous read fault returns `EFAULT` without publishing partial output;
an already quarantined domain returns `EIO` before any reads. Diagnostic
faults do not quarantine a domain or prevent provider registration. There
are no retries, polling delays, new mappings, W1C writes or GPU accesses.
Reading ISR/AISR preserves events; only writes of one clear their bits.

Output includes both samples and a changed-register mask in table order.
Channel metadata is decoded only for stable Arm PCK-600/PPU v1.1 identity
and a valid channel configuration. Unknown identities remain raw values.
Neither recognized metadata nor equal samples establish GPU readiness.
MISR exposes input levels, not the internal transition phase or PREQ output.
The lock excludes native provider writers, not autonomous hardware changes.
Fault-aware access cannot guarantee completion of a stalled bus transaction.

Ordinary `pdc_get` still reads only PWPR/PMER/PWSR twice and retains its
strict errors. In physical kernel #6, CORE6 had policy `8`, emulation `0`
and status `0`, hence `EBUSY`. Matched physical #7 confirms that mismatch
and identifies both domains as one-Q-Channel PCK-600/PPU v1.1. Both have
PWCR `0x101`; CORE MISR is `0`, whereas TOP MISR is `0x100`.
All 80 reads succeeded with unchanged samples. The [physical receipt](a733-gpu-identification.md#physical-result-2026-10-08)
records the remaining values and scope. Arm DEN0051E section 5.2.8 requires the requested static mode to
be reached before changing PWCR.DEVREQEN. The pinned BSP's manual
`PWCR=0; PWPR=8` GPU initialization is therefore not a justified recovery
sequence for that mismatch. No active initialization is added here.

## Reproduce the software checks

The contract compiles the actual driver and FDT implementation, with bus,
clock and FDT primitives replaced by deterministic C fixtures. It needs a
host C compiler and shell; it does not need Python or a board.

```sh
sh ember/tools/a733-power-contract.sh
POWER_TEST_CFLAGS='-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer' \
    sh ember/tools/a733-power-contract.sh
```

The 45 scenarios cover enable/disable, delayed completion, idempotence,
preserved policy bits, timeout, denial, each ignored register write,
quarantine, invalid IDs, GPU_CORE protection, firmware policy protection,
attachment failure cleanup, truncated FDT data, checked errors and the
legacy callback path. A separate 1,661-check matrix covers strict read-only
state queries. The diagnostic adds 236 scenarios covering exact read order,
each acquisition fault, unchanged error output, each changed field,
recognized P/Q and unknown identities, quarantine and attachment behavior.
These are software contracts, not physical MMIO tests.

The expanded diagnostic passes on Apple Silicon macOS, including ASan/UBSan
and eight rejecting mutation controls. Its PCK object and target contract
cross-build with the corrected Ports GCC 16.2. The target contract also
passes under physical kernel #6 with fake MMIO; the expanded physical
register snapshot remains pending.

Earlier provider validation used separate `EMBER64` object directories to
cross-build the driver, R-CCU, FDT power-domain code
and unchanged Apple PMGR using GCC 12.5 and the corrected Ports GCC 16.2.
The GCC16 objects retain DWARF5 and CTF, with strict kernel warnings enabled.
Both Zero 3W and Zero 4 DTBs compiled and decoded with the provider present.
The existing `/soc` unit-address warning remains; no new DT warning appeared.

The complete GCC16.2 `EMBER64` kernel, four matching modules and both A733
DTBs subsequently cross-built on macOS. On 2026-10-08 the matched Zero 3W
bundle booted through vendor boot0/U-Boot. Its log identifies `sun60ipck0`
and both A733 CCU providers; Wi-Fi/SSH and 37 local-socket checks passed.
The booted ELF SHA256 is
`b66cf8eae6199946810ea6e67d77b716aaa5b7b61357c096d8f6dff53f65cbbe`.
This verifies provider attachment, not accelerator power transitions.
The later GPU consumer currently enables only
[read-only observation](a733-gpu-identification.md). Active supplies,
device clocks/resets, identification, DMA/MMU, IRQs and command execution
remain separate steps.
Use the [cross-build instructions](cross-build.md) from a clean commit,
including matching modules and DTBs; do not mix these artifacts across builds.
