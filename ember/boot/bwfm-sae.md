# External SAE in bwfm

EmberBSD connects upstream wpa_supplicant 2.11 SAE and its host four-way
handshake to the CYW43455 external-authentication firmware interface. The OS
repository owns the client, driver ABI and tests. On 2026-10-08 a physical
[CM5 on Waveshare CM5-NANO-B](../boards/compute-module-5.md#hardware-check-2026-10-08)
passed SAE group 19/H2E, required PMF, bidirectional file transfer, reconnects,
wrong-password rejection, a WPA2 regression and startup after reboot.

The tested station mode uses CCMP and required PMF with BIP-CMAC-128. This
is not Wi-Fi certification or validation on every bwfm radio. It does not add
fast transition, autonomous firmware roaming, 802.11v policy, SAE password
offload or multi-link operation. Other SAE groups/modes need separate checks.
Existing WPA2 connections keep their host handshake. Unsupported radios,
old kernels and clients built without CONFIG_SAE do not advertise SAE.

## Configuration and verification

Install the updated kernel, matching modules and base wpa_supplicant together.
Preserve a working Ethernet path and a rollback copy before radio testing.
An access point offering SAE and PMF is required. A transition-mode access
point can be used, but the test client must permit only SAE:

```conf
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
sae_pwe=2
network={
    ssid="YOUR-SSID"
    key_mgmt=SAE
    ieee80211w=2
    pairwise=CCMP
    group=CCMP
    sae_password="YOUR-PASSWORD"
}
```

Keep `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` owned by root with mode 0600. The password
must be the original passphrase; a WPA2-derived PSK is insufficient. Keep
private profiles and logs out of source control. Never enable supplicant
key logging to collect public evidence.

Use the normal NetBSD wpa_supplicant service with the BSD driver and `bwfm0`.
After association, inspect:

```sh
wpa_cli -i bwfm0 status
sysctl -w hw.bwfm0.report=1
dmesg | tail -100
```

The accepted CM5 connection reports `wpa_state=COMPLETED`, `key_mgmt=SAE`,
`pmf=1`, `mgmt_group_cipher=BIP`, `sae_group=19` and `sae_h2e=1`.
On the tested firmware the driver report also shows `wsec=0x604`,
`wpa_auth=0x40000` and `mfp=2`. Verify the firmware state after traffic-key
installation: a successful SAE exchange alone does not prove PMF stayed on.
Raw interface diagnostics may expose keys; redact private logs before sharing.

If Ethernet and Wi-Fi share a subnet, an SSH connection to the Wi-Fi address
alone does not establish the return path. Check the route to the test peer
and verify it uses bwfm0 in both directions. Do not disable the management
interface just to establish that route.

## Interface and security boundaries

`IEEE80211_IOC_SAE` is additive. Version 1 uses fixed-width fields, a bounded
1536-byte payload, a peer address and a userspace association generation.
The getter returns capabilities only. Configuration, frame transmission,
authentication status and IGTK operations require interface administration
privilege. Authentication traffic is accepted only for the active peer and
generation while the interface is authenticating. Stale status cannot
authorize a new association. Passwords and PMKs remain in userspace.

`RTM_IEEE80211_SAE` forwards external-auth requests and received authentication
frames. The supplicant checks their sizes, peer and generation before passing
them to its upstream SAE implementation. Firmware provides CCMP and PMF;
the driver installs management keys at IGTK indexes 4 and 5.

CYW43455 firmware 7.45.265 advertises `sae_ext`, not full SAE offload.
Its external-auth request flags can be zero; the event type identifies the
request. The driver accepts unsupported `sup_wpa=0` when firmware has no
internal supplicant. Other security-setup failures abort the association.
Changing PMF can require the radio down. Setting `wsec` clears PMF, so the
driver sets and verifies PMF last, then preserves it while installing keys.
Firmware commands are serialized through their response, and BCDC identifiers
wrap to their 16-bit wire width. Disconnect also aborts the firmware join.

## Build and checks

Build a matched kernel/modules bundle and base wpa_supplicant from the same
clean source revision using the [cross-build instructions](cross-build.md).
The client requires the existing OpenSSL-enabled build. Install its updated
net80211 headers into the target sysroot before compiling the client.
Do not combine a new client binary with an unrelated kernel acceptance claim.

The portable parser regression can run under address/undefined sanitizers:

```sh
cc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -fsanitize=address,undefined \
    ember/tools/bwfm-sae-contract.c -o /tmp/bwfm-sae-contract
/tmp/bwfm-sae-contract
```

Its 106 assertions cover RSN ciphers/PMF, truncation, management suites,
bounded PMKID counts, capability tokens and firmware request peer/SSID bounds.
Compile `ember/tools/bwfm-sae-ioctl.c` for NetBSD and run it as root on the
target interface with the supplicant stopped. Its 13 live checks deliberately
disable SAE and exercise lengths, versions, reserved fields, inactive status
and unprivileged requests. Restore the service after this test.

Hardware acceptance requires actual bidirectional traffic, disconnect/reconnect,
wrong-password rejection without WPA2 fallback, an independent WPA2 profile,
and automatic startup after reboot. The board receipt records completed
checks and limits; one board and one access point are not a compatibility matrix.

## Provenance

The external-auth firmware protocol follows Raspberry Pi Linux
[`brcmfmac`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/tree/43c132e8863c3bff3647033b6a7d2bf87b15501c/drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac),
specifically `cfg80211.c`, `fwil_types.h` and `fweh.h`. Those sources retain
Broadcom Corporation copyright (2010 and 2012) under ISC. EmberBSD implements
the protocol using its existing bwfm command transport and NetBSD interfaces;
the cryptographic SAE implementation remains upstream wpa_supplicant.
