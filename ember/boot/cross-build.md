# Build AArch64 kernels on another host

EmberBSD does not require a NetBSD build host. The kernel wrapper uses the
fork's standard `build.sh` on macOS and other foreign hosts. That script
builds host executables which generate AArch64 NetBSD output. A native
AArch64 NetBSD build remains available.

## Build from pinned sources

Export a clean commit of the **full source tree**. A kernel-only export
without `tools`, `share/mk` and their source dependencies is insufficient.
Use a host C/C++ compiler and the host Python 3 for the existing source
contracts. On macOS, install the Xcode command-line tools first. Do not use
the target's `/usr/pkg/etc/mk.conf` as the host OS build configuration.

```sh
revision=FULL_COMMIT_ID
src=/absolute/source
out=/absolute/build-output
mkdir "$src"
git archive "$revision" | tar -xf - -C "$src"
NETBSD2_JOBS=6 sh "$src/ember/build-kernel.sh" "$out" EMBER64
```

The output must be outside the source tree. Keep one output directory per
source export, kernel configuration and toolchain. The default `cross` mode
uses `build.sh` on every host, including NetBSD.
Cross-compilation on the development machine is the preferred build path;
VMs and boards execute acceptance checks. `EMBER_BUILD_MODE=native` selects
the native fallback explicitly and rejects a host which cannot run it.
The optional `auto` mode retains the earlier host-based selection.

Cross builds keep host tools under `out/tools`, object files under `out/obj`
and the kernel configuration's generated headers under `out/obj/kernels`.
The four board modules use the same make wrapper, target settings and kernel
headers. DTBs use the target preprocessor and the source-built host `nbdtc`.
`build.sh -u` reuses tools and object files for repeated builds. A failed build
returns nonzero and does not leave the previous candidate at the deliverable
paths. Build logs remain in the output directory.

`NETBSD2_JOBS` selects concurrency. `NETBSD2_PYTHON` can select an existing
host Python executable; there is no fixed Python 3.13 requirement. These
legacy Python source contracts have not yet been replaced.

## Compiler selection

The fork's in-tree bootstrap compiler is currently GCC 12.5. Building it as
a host tool does not install it on the target or prove the GCC 16.2 transition.
The current native development package is GCC 16.2.0nb1 from
[EmberBSD-Ports](https://github.com/oxtech-ember/EmberBSD-Ports/tree/main/profiles/development-toolchain).

To use a separately prepared GNU cross toolchain, provide its absolute
prefix. It must supply `bin/aarch64--netbsd-gcc`, `cpp`, `c++` and the matching
prefixed binutils commands expected by `EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN` in `share/mk`.
Use a fresh output directory when changing toolchains.
The wrapper sets `TOOLCHAIN_MISSING=yes` for this path to omit the in-tree
bootstrap compiler and its host math libraries. Other required host tools
are still built from the selected source revision. In particular, host
Binutils supplies BFD for `dbsym` and `mdsetimage`; an external compiler
prefix alone does not provide those libraries.

BFD source generators use explicit template paths for both GNU make and
BSD make. The former BSD-only automatic variable expanded to an empty input
under the GNU make used by host Binutils. The regression
`ember/tools/binutils-generators-contract.sh` executes all 18 recipes from
both source Makefiles with each make and three source-directory layouts;
216 generated outputs match. This is separate from a complete tools build.

```sh
EMBER_BUILD_MODE=cross EMBER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN=/absolute/cross-prefix \
    NETBSD2_JOBS=6 sh "$src/ember/build-kernel.sh" /absolute/new-output EMBER64
```

This parameter selects tools; it does not fetch or build a GCC16 cross
compiler. The [Ports cross recipe](https://github.com/oxtech-ember/EmberBSD-Ports/tree/main/profiles/development-toolchain/cross)
provides the host compiler and preserves its current source adaptations.

## Acceptance is separate from host selection

The wrapper retains the native six-contract suite. On a foreign host it
runs the two portable contracts and explicitly records the remaining native
contracts as pending. Copy the same pinned source export to an EmberBSD
machine and run all six there before deploying the artifacts:

```sh
NETBSD2_PYTHON=/path/to/python3 sh ember/tools/kernel-contracts.sh /absolute/source all
```

Those four additional tests compile against NetBSD Bluetooth/audio headers
and execute their probes. Their runtime requirement is not a build-host
restriction. Passing them does not prove that a new kernel boots, that a
module attaches, or that physical Bluetooth/audio works.

Run the shell orchestration regression on any host:

```sh
sh ember/tests/build-kernel.sh
```

After host tools have produced a make wrapper, check its actual dependency
selection with `sh ember/tests/external-toolchain-tools.sh
/absolute/output/tools/bin/nbmake-evbarm /absolute/source`.

It checks foreign/native command routing, target tool expansion, module
header selection, contract dispatch and failure propagation. Its fixtures
are not a kernel build. For underlying build options see [BUILDING](../../BUILDING)
and the [NetBSD cross-build guide](https://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-build.html).

## Verified scope

On Apple Silicon macOS, the wrapper built the in-tree host tools, full
`EMBER64`, four board modules and all three DTBs. The two portable contracts
passed on that host; the full six-contract suite passed in AArch64 NetBSD
UTM. The kernel build used the in-tree GCC12.5 bootstrap. It has not been
booted on a board as part of this cross-build check.

Separately, Ports GCC16 built on macOS and cross-compiled C11 plain/LTO and
C++20 shared-library probes. They pass on physical Orange Pi Zero 3W with
its installed GCC16 runtime.

On 2026-10-08, the external GCC16.2 path built the full `EMBER64`, four
matched modules and three DTBs from `21cd2464c720159bec0a3ba352e4dee940a58b02`.
Kernel C objects retain GCC's default DWARF5 and the linked kernel contains
CTF. Strict compiler warnings remain enabled. The kernel SHA256 is
`d79c53a823855211c613245808c6f588d418c9e5bd83990ff3dc60cee643b54c`.
It cold-booted in AArch64 UTM with network and disk access. The installed
kernel passes fresh-exec FP defaults, fork/signal/thread state preservation
and exec reset from altered FP state. The font ioctl ownership regression
passes with GCC16 in that guest and with host ASan/UBSan; the original
handler fails its pointer-preservation assertion. Run it with:

```sh
sh ember/tests/wsdisplay-font.sh /absolute/source /absolute/new-test-output
```

This accepts the GCC16 kernel build and VM boot, not a complete GCC16-built
userland, a new physical-board deployment or board-module attachment.
All six native source contracts subsequently passed with the installed
Python 3.14 package. [Live DTrace](dtrace-dwarf.md) also passes in this VM
with matching modules and typed FBT arguments from the GCC16 kernel's CTF.

## DWARF5 and CTF

The CTF converter accepts ordinary DWARF5 C compilation units. The libdwarf
adaptation resolves indexed strings, including the two-byte index form,
loads and relocates the string-offset table, accepts implicit constants
and retains a relocation ending exactly at a section boundary. Invalid
string tables fail explicitly instead of producing unnamed CTF types.
GCC16 can keep its upstream DWARF5 default; no DWARF4 override is required.

Run the host conversion regression with the GCC16 cross driver and a host
Clang capable of emitting AArch64 NetBSD ELF:

```sh
sh ember/tests/ctf-dwarf.sh /absolute/cross/bin/aarch64--netbsd-gcc \
    /absolute/clang /absolute/output/tools /absolute/new-test-output
```

It compares actual GCC/Clang CTF types for DWARF4/5 and DWARF32/64, including
arrays, enums, bitfields and function pointers. It also checks more than
256 string indices, exact-end relocation, malformed tables and ctfmerge.
The separate [external DWARF and DTrace acceptance](dtrace-dwarf.md) covers
native CTF execution and live tracing. The [external type-unit guide](ctf-external-types.md)
extends conversion to GNU/standard split objects, DWP v2/v5, combined
supplements and multiple primary CUs, with explicit ownership limits. General
DWARF5 location-list evaluation is not established by type conversion.
