# EmberBSD: hardware adaptations and build instructions

EmberBSD is an independent NetBSD 11 fork for single-board computers and
embedded systems. Its primary target is Raspberry Pi 5. The repository
preserves the NetBSD source tree and history, adding device drivers,
kernel fixes, and build tools for specific boards. Changes in this fork
should not be treated as changes accepted by the NetBSD developers.

The kernel and common sources are based on the verified NetBSD 11.0
`syssrc.tgz` release archive. The rest of the tree retains the upstream
`netbsd-11` snapshot recorded in `ember/source.json`. The adaptation patches
are already applied to the source tree. Copies in `ember/patches` document
their provenance and support future porting; do not apply them again.

## Hardware support and validation

The [board catalog](ember/boards/README.md) is the maintained hardware index.
Select a board there for its capability table, boot path, detailed notes and
validation limits. The [short board selector](README.md#supported-boards) stays
in the root README; detailed support is maintained on each board page.
See [adding a board](ember/boards/adding-a-board.md) for external contributions.

The following accessory and protocol limits also apply:

| Platform or feature | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Raspberry Pi 5: built-in Bluetooth over UART | H4 receive fix, SSP/Secure Connections, authentication, encryption, and reconnection with an iPhone tested on hardware |
| WM8960 Audio HAT over RP1 | Microphones and speaker output tested; output loudness depends on the attached speakers |
| USB audio | One USB Audio Module A showed repeated device disconnections during playback; stable operation has not been confirmed |
| AirPods | Connection confirmed; reliable audio quality and headset microphone operation have not been confirmed |
| ELM327 | Testing with a physical adapter is still pending |
| BLE | Not implemented in the added Bluetooth management tools |
| CAN FD | Raw sockets, virtual canlo interfaces and canconfig mode control pass native rump checks; physical drivers and data-phase timing are not implemented ([guide](ember/can/README.md)) |

The `bwfm` driver leaves roaming and WPA authentication to the host.
It disables firmware WNM transitions as well as autonomous roaming:
CYW43455 firmware 7.45.265 can otherwise select SAE after a band-steering
request in a mixed WPA2/WPA3 network while the host still holds WPA2 keys.
This does not add WPA3 or 802.11v support. An access point may disconnect
a station, after which NetBSD scans and joins again. The on-demand
`hw.bwfm0.report` diagnostic includes radio authentication and station
counters to distinguish this failure from an SDIO transmit-window stall.

## Building

Cross-compilation on the development host is the preferred path. The wrapper
uses the fork's `build.sh` by default on macOS and NetBSD alike. Set
`EMBER_BUILD_MODE=native` explicitly for a required NetBSD/AArch64 fallback.
Use a full source export of a pinned commit and an existing host Python 3
for the legacy source contracts; see the [cross-build guide](ember/boot/cross-build.md):

```sh
sh ember/build-kernel.sh /absolute/output EMBER64
```

The build produces an ELF kernel, a native kernel image, device trees for
Zero 2 W, Orange Pi Zero 4 and Zero 3W, and Ethernet, Bluetooth UART, and WM8960
modules, plus the optional Pi 5 power-button fallback module. Foreign-host
builds run portable contracts and report native contracts as pending; run
the full suite on EmberBSD before deployment. The
[headless base update](ember/boot/aarch64-base-update.md) builds the fork's
kernel, required board modules and base userland together. Its Pi 5 hardware
receipt is separate from validation of a complete general release image.

The [AArch64 development image](ember/image/README.md) combines verified
NetBSD 11 base sets, an accepted EmberBSD kernel, the corrected static
`fsck_ffs`, CTF/libdwarf 2.2, and the Ports GDB 18.1nb1/LLVM 23.1.2nb1
package closure. All eighteen packages install offline. Installed GDB, DWP
and CTF matrices pass on first boot and after a normal reboot in QEMU/HVF.
This is a bounded development image, not a complete OS rebuilt with GCC16
or a physical-board installation image.

For an AArch64 desktop VM, see the [UTM framebuffer configuration](ember/boot/utm-framebuffer.md).
It documents the PCI ownership fix, the `viogpu` boot override and the
visible-display regression check.

Build Raspberry Pi 5 UEFI firmware using Docker on macOS or Linux:

```sh
bash ember/build-firmware.sh /absolute/cache --rp1-console
```

The eotics firmware source and submodules are pinned. The adaptation patch
order is defined in `ember/firmware/series`. Standard, console, and diagnostic
variants use separate output directories. Radio firmware assets are fetched
according to `ember/boot/image-assets.tsv`, with hash verification and
license preservation; their binaries are not included in the repository.

The RV32 kernels are cross-built with the stock `build.sh`:

```sh
./build.sh -U -u -m riscv -a riscv32 -O /absolute/obj -T /absolute/tools tools kernel=ESP32S31
```

`ESP32S31` runs in QEMU `virt` with 16 MB and on the board with Ethernet.
`ESP32S31W` adds the radio and needs the vendor libraries prepared as one
object file; without it the configuration does not link. Board boot loaders
and flash layout are prepared outside this tree.

Orange Pi Zero 4 and Zero 3W start through the board vendor's boot0 and
U-Boot. They are closed binaries and are not included in the repository: an
image builder copies them from the vendor's own card image; the Zero 4
binaries start the Zero 3W as well. U-Boot then runs
`ember/boot/orangepi-zero4-boot.cmd`, which loads the native kernel and
the device tree from the first partition. The boot loader does not name
the board, so the script reads the pins of the Ethernet MAC: with no PHY
they float and follow the pull resistors both ways, and only then the
Zero 3W tree is chosen.

Starting a UEFI rebuild removes the previous output for the selected
variant. If Docker or compilation fails, an image builder will stop because
the required input is missing. The host-side contract check covers this
case: `python3 ember/tools/firmware-contract.py`.

## Deploying to a device

This repository provides OS sources, hardware adaptations, and build tools.
It can serve as a base for devices running different applications.
Applications are installed separately and are not required to build the
kernel or UEFI firmware.

For reproducible builds, pin the fork commit and verify the hashes of the
resulting components. An installation image must contain compatible
kernels, modules, firmware, and NetBSD userland. A fully validated general
installation image of this fork has not yet been published.

Wi-Fi configuration, SSH keys, tokens, and other credentials are added by
the operator when preparing each device and remain outside Git. Bluetooth
bonds are tied to the controller: when moving to another board, use its
address and its own bonds. Personalized images containing these settings
are not intended for public distribution.

## Upstream and licensing

Upstream is [NetBSD/src](https://github.com/NetBSD/src), the official CVS
mirror. This fork's `main` branch maintains its own history; automatic
mirror updates do not alter already published fork revisions. Upstream
updates are incorporated through separate commits followed by rebuilds
and hardware validation.

NetBSD and third-party licenses remain in the source files. Additional
utilities under `ember/` use the BSD-2-Clause license, except where a file
carries its own license.
